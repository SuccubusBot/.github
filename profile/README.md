# Welcome to the Succubus‚ú® Bot Project
**SuccubusBot is a feature-rich Discord bot, designed for Anime communities.** We offer AI Chat, Images, Video, ASMR, Manga Reader and more!

This GitHub organization serves as our main source code repository, for all microservices, internal libraries and [the Wiki](https://wiki.succubus.bot). Currently, there are no open-sourced repositories (as much as we'd like), due to contributor privacy concerns.
